# MRI Brain Protocols  ## Headache/Sinus Venous Thrombosis (SVT)  - FLAIR: Swelling of inadequately drained parenchyma? - DWI: Congestive ischemia? - T2: Transverse sinus. Hyperintense gaps (thrombus)? Hypoplasia? - SWI: Secondary congestion hemorrhage? - 4D TRAK: Start 10s after injection. Asymmetric perfusion? - MPRAGE: After contrast. Caution: Chronic thrombi may be contrast-enhancing and thus appear masked.  ## Dizziness  - FLAIR - DWI: Brainstem/cerebellar ischemia? If brainstem ischemia suspected. - Arterial TOF-MRA: Vascular-nerve contact? (Usually AICA loop with cranial nerve VIII, often physiological without pathological relevance) - T1 Dixon - CISS: Start 1 min after contrast. Visualization of cranial nerve exit/internal auditory canal. - T1 Dixon: After contrast. Space-occupying lesion in cerebellopontine angle (schwannoma â contrast-enhancing?).  ## Multiple Sclerosis (MS)  - DIR - FLAIR - MPR - MPR with contrast: Optional after contrast if acute relapse suspected.  ## Optic Neuritis (ON)  - DIR - FLAIR - MPR - T1 Dixon: Orbit - T2 Dixon: After contrast - MPR with contrast - T1 Dixon: After contrast, orbit  ## Abscess/Encephalitis  - FLAIR - DWI - SWI: Useful for differentiating fungal abscess (central susceptibility) vs. bacterial abscess ('dual-rim sign'). Hemorrhagic encephalitis (e.g., herpes encephalitis) â cortical susceptibility. Rare hemorrhagic encephalitides: Japanese encephalitis/Dengue. - MPR - T2 TSE: If encephalitis is suspected, scan hippocampus; otherwise, scan over abscess. - MPR with contrast - FLAIR with contrast: Optional. Further delineation of leptomeningeal enhancement â subarachnoid empyema?  ## Meningitis  - FLAIR - SWI - T1 MPRAGE - T1 MPRAGE with contrast - FLAIR with contrast  ## Vasculitis (Intra- and Extracranial)  - FLAIR: Past ischemia as an indicator of chronic progression? - SWI: Asymmetric intracranial vessel visualization? - DWI: Secondary ischemia due to vasoconstriction? - Arterial TOF-MRA: Look for caliber changes ('string of beads' pattern)? - 3D T1 SE BB - 3D T1 SE BB with contrast: Caution: Often 'false-positive' enhancement of carotid branches; compare with the contralateral side. Temporal arteritis cannot be reliably diagnosed by MRI.  ## Subacute Ischemia  - FLAIR - SWI - DWI - Arterial TOF-MRA: More emphasis on flow than morphology; optional if a good CTA is available.  ## Brainstem Ischemia  - FLAIR - DWI - SWI - T2: Focus on brainstem. Should primarily be used to demarcate infarcts, as FLAIR is often artifact-prone near the skull base. - Arterial TOF-MRA: More emphasis on flow than morphology; optional if a good CTA is available.  ## Dissection  - FLAIR - SWI - DWI: Ischemia in the affected vascular territory â acute therapeutic implications (e.g., lysis) - T1 SPIR: From carotid bifurcation to carotid siphon. Crescent-shaped intraluminal hematoma, hyperintense after approx. 3 days. - T2 SPAIR: Same as T1 SPIR. Time-dependent signal changes. - High-resolution neck angio: Bolus triggering.  ## Hypoxic Brain Injury  - FLAIR: Hyperintensity in basal ganglia? - DWI - T1 FFE: Hyperintensity in laminar cortical necrosis? Blurred corticomedullary differentiation? - SWI  ## Glioma  - FLAIR - MPRAGE - DWI - PWI: After contrast - T2 - MPRAGE with contrast  ## Epilepsy  - FLAIR: Focus search: Mass lesion? FCD: Transmantle sign? - SWI: Focus search: Hemorrhage? - DIR: FCD: Transmantle sign? Focus search: Cortical developmental disorders? - T2: Tilt over hippocampus. Mesial temporal sclerosis â Temporal lobe epilepsy? - MPRAGE: Volumetric analysis. - DWI: Only in the acute phase; often diffusion restriction in hippocampus/pulvinar/cortex.  ## Dementia  - FLAIR - SWI: Microbleeds? Indications for Lewy body disease? - MPRAGE  ## Parkinson's Disease  - FLAIR - SWI - T2 - MPRAGE  ## Encephalopathy  - FLAIR: Wernicke encephalopathy: Hyperintensity in mammillary bodies/dorsomedial thalamus/mammillary bodies. Toxic encephalopathy: Hyperintensities generally corpus callosum-associated and in centrum semiovale. Hepatic encephalopathy: Insular hyperintensities, posterior limb of internal capsule, thalamus. NBIA: 'Eye of the tiger' in anteromedial globus pallidus. Wilson's disease: 'Face of the giant panda' in midbrain. - MPR - DWI: Often diffusion restriction overlapping with FLAIR changes. - SWI: If Wilson's disease or NBIA is suspected (hypointensity of basal ganglia due to copper/iron accumulation). - T2 with contrast - MPR with contrast  ## Cranial Nerves  - FLAIR - T1 Dixon - 3D CISS: After contrast - TOF: Optional if vascular-nerve contact is suspected. - DWI: Optional if acute pathology is suspected. - T1 Dixon: After contrast  ## Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus  - T2 FLAIR: Callosal angle, DESH, CSF leakage, etc. - CSF Drive: Aqueduct/foramina of Monro. - CSF PCA: Flow visualization. - T2: Aqueduct stenosis?  ## Pituitary Mass  - FLAIR - T2 - T1: Parallel to the pituitary stalk. - T1 dynamic: Not for follow-up! Only for initial detection, as pituitary adenomas typically enhance slowly. Start contrast and scan simultaneously. - T1 after contrast  ## Orbit  - FLAIR - T1 Dixon: Orbit - T2 Dixon - T1 Dixon: After contrast, orbi
